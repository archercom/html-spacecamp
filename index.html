            <p>On December 17, 1903, on a windy North Carolina beach for just shy of one hundred seconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a heavier-than-air, self-propelled vehicle could fly. The moment was elec- tric and its importance widely understood. Almost immediately, there was an explosion of interest in this newfound technology of manned flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build upon it.</p>

            <p>At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American law held that a property owner presumptively owned not just the sur- face of his land, but all the land below, down to the center of the earth, and all the space above, to “an indefinite extent, upwards.”1 For many years, scholars had puzzled about how best to interpret the idea that rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean that you owned the stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and regular trespass?</p>
            <p>Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of Amer- ican law—deep within the foundations of our tradition, and acknowl- edged by the most important legal thinkers of our past—mattered. If my land reaches to the heavens, what happens when United flies over my field? Do I have the right to banish it from my property? Am I allowed to enter into an exclusive license with Delta Airlines? Could we set up an auction to decide how much these rights are worth?</p>

            <p>In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Car- olina farmers Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens because of low-flying military aircraft (the terrified chickens appar- ently flew into the barn walls and died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit say- ing that the government was trespassing on their land. The airplanes, of course, never touched the surface of the Causbys’ land. But if, as Blackstone, Kent, and Coke had said, their land reached to “an indefi- nite extent, upwards,” then the government was trespassing on their property, and the Causbys wanted it to stop.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys’ case. Congress had declared the airways public, but if one’s property really extended to the heavens, then Congress’s declaration could well have been an unconsti- tutional “taking” of property without compensation. The Court ac- knowledged that “it is ancient doctrine that common law ownership of the land extended to the periphery of the universe.” But Justice Douglas had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single paragraph, hundreds of years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the Court,</p>
            <blockquote>[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a public highway, as Congress has declared. Were that not true, every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to count- less trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea. To recognize such private claims to the airspace would clog these highways, se- riously interfere with their control and development in the public interest, and transfer into private ownership that to which only the public has a just claim.</blockquote>
            <p>“Common sense revolts at the idea.”</p>
            <p>This is how the law usually works. Not often this abruptly or impa- tiently, but eventually, this is how it works. It was Douglas’s style not to dither. Other justices would have blathered on for pages to reach the conclusion that Douglas holds in a single line: “Common sense revolts at the idea.” But whether it takes pages or a few words, it is the special genius of a common law system, as ours is, that the law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it changes. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in another.</p>
            <p>Or at least, this is how things happen when there’s no one powerful on the other side of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And though there were no doubt many like them who were upset by the growing traffic in the air (though one hopes not many chickens flew themselves into walls), the Causbys of the world would find it very hard to unite and stop the idea, and the technology, that the Wright brothers had birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into the technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken coop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by “what seemed reasonable” given the technology that the Wrights had pro- duced. They could stand on their farms, dead chickens in hand, and shake their fists at these newfangled technologies all they wanted. They could call their representatives or even file a lawsuit. But in the end, the force of what seems “obvious” to everyone else—the power of “common sense”—would prevail. Their “private interest” would not be allowed to defeat an obvious public gain.</p>
            <p>Edwin Howard Armstrong is one of America’s forgotten inventor geniuses. He came to the great American inventor scene just after the titans Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. But his work in the area of radio technology was perhaps the most important of any single inventor in the first fifty years of radio. He was better educated than Michael Faraday, who as a bookbinder’s apprentice had discov- ered electric induction in 1831. But he had the same intuition about how the world of radio worked, and on at least three occasions, Arm- strong invented profoundly important technologies that advanced our understanding of radio.</p>
